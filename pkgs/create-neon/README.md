# Create Neon

The `create-neon` tool bootstraps [Neon](https://neon-bindings.com) projects, which allows developers to build binary Node modules written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

## Usage

You can conveniently use this tool with the [`npm init`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-init) syntax:

```sh
$ npm init neon my-project
```
